'''
After pinging the server, print the Round Trip Time (RTT)
when the server responds with the corresponding pong.

TO DO:
- packet loss detection
- send retransmission

Notes on Packet Loss
Packets can arrive to find a full queue - but with no place to store such packet, the router will drop that packet i.e. the packe twill be lost.

A packet loss will look like a packet having been transmitted into the network core but never emerging from the network at the destination. The fraction of lost packets increases as traffic intensity increases
